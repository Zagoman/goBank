# GoBank, a bank API written in go

This repository represents an attempt of learning how to structure an API with go, including Authentication with JWT token, Docker container running a Postgress server, and more. 

Majority of the code on this repository was achieved following the tutorial from [Anthony GG](https://github.com/anthdm), therefore, I am not claiming ownership or rights over this code, since most of it was not created by me.
